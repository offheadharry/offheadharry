### Hi there, I'm Harry Burrell (aka Offheadharry)

I am an avid investor in blockchain technology and have since started freelance work with Combased. Previously a community moderator for FrizzyNFT. My experience is largely with MultiversX ($EGLD). I have learnt a lot about running communities, marketing on social media and blockchain networks in this time. 

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

I took up the opportunity to apply to HyperionDev's Software Engineering Bootcamp this year and received a fully funded scholarship. Topics include in-depth #Python, #SQL, #Django, #CSS, #HTML, and more. I aim to use the skills learnt in this course to kickstart my career in the tech space. It's my goal to build on the blockchain to create new use cases and applications for networks.
